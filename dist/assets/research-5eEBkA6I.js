        ε Phase 1: R Programming Foundations Ε
        ρ Ρ 
        Interns begin by building technical fluency in R, one of the most widely used programming languages in research and data science.
        Through guided modules led by our in-house biostatisticians and computer science mentors, students learn to:
        λ
        π Set up their R environment Π
        π Clean and organize data Π
        π Run bibliometric commands Π
        π Create basic visualizations (e.g., word clouds, co-authorship networks) Π
        Λ
        No prior coding experience is required, as this phase is designed to be beginner-friendly yet rigorous!

        ε Phase 2: Bibliometric Analysis & Data Visualization Ε
        ρ Ρ
        Next, interns move into the core analysis phase, where they extract real citation and authorship data from Web of Science (WoS) exports and organize it using Microsoft Excel and R.
        They will:
        λ
        π Perform keyword and citation analysis Π
        π Identify research trends and gaps Π
        π Create publication graphs, topic maps, and collaboration networks Π
        π Learn to interpret and refine bibliometric figures Π
        Λ
        This phase emphasizes bibliometric computation and modeling, transforming raw citation data into structured datasets and visual analytics.
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ

        ε Phase 3: Research Communication & Presentation Ε
        ρ Ρ
        In the final phase, interns translate their analysis into professional research deliverables, including a graduate-level abstract, a research poster formatted for academic conferences, and an oral presentation.
        Interns receive mentorship on public speaking, design, and how to effectively communicate complex ideas to diverse audiences, preparing them for real-world academic and professional settings.
