        ε Phase 1: R Programming Foundations Ε
        ρ Ρ 
        Interns begin by building technical fluency in R, one of the most widely used programming languages in research and data science.
        Through guided modules led by our in-house biostatisticians and computer science mentors, students learn to:
        λ
        π Set up their R environment Π
        π Clean and organize data Π
        π Run bibliometric commands Π
        π Create basic visualizations (e.g., word clouds, co-authorship networks) Π
        Λ
        No prior coding experience is required, as this phase is designed to be beginner-friendly yet rigorous!
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ

        ε Phase 2: Bibliometric Analysis & Data Visualization Ε
        ρ Ρ
        Next, interns move into the core analysis phase, where they extract real citation and authorship data from Web of Science (WoS) exports and organize it using Microsoft Excel and R.
        They will:
        λ
        π Perform keyword and citation analysis Π
        π Identify research trends and gaps Π
        π Create publication graphs, topic maps, and collaboration networks Π
        π Learn to interpret and refine bibliometric figures Π
        Λ
        This phase emphasizes bibliometric computation and modeling, transforming raw citation data into structured datasets and visual analytics.
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ

        ε Phase 3: Research Communication & Presentation Ε
        ρ Ρ
        In the final phase, interns translate their analysis into professional research deliverables, including a graduate-level abstract, a research poster formatted for academic conferences, and an oral presentation.
        Interns receive mentorship on public speaking, design, and how to effectively communicate complex ideas to diverse audiences, preparing them for real-world academic and professional settings.
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ
        Many interns have gone on to submit their posters to local and national conferences with success. Their research skills and communication training developed throughout the BRI program have:
        λ
        π Translated into stronger college and graduate school applications. Π
        π Opened doors to research positions at local universities and further academic opportunities. Π
        Λ
        The success of past interns is highlighted in the case studies featured below.
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ

        ε Tools & Platforms You'll Learn Ε
        ρ Ρ
        Throughout the program, interns gain hands-on experience with a range of tools commonly used in academic research, data science, and presentation design:
        λ
        π R Programming – for data cleaning, bibliometric analysis, and visualization Π
        π Web of Science (WoS) – to export citation and authorship data Π
        π Microsoft Excel – to organize, structure, and sort datasets Π
        π Zotero – to manage references and citation metadata Π
        π Google Slides / Canva – to design clear, professional posters and presentations Π
        Λ
        These tools are introduced gradually throughout each phase of the curriculum, with beginner-friendly guidance and support from mentors through our custom-built modules, dedicated Slack channels, and live bi-weekly office hours.
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ

        ε ThinkNeuro AI Suite (Beta) Ε
        ρ Ρ
        As part of our commitment to innovation, ThinkNeuro is beta testing the ThinkNeuro AI Suite: a collection of AI-powered tools designed to support BRI interns throughout their research journey.
        ρ Ρ
        Interns will receive early access to:
        λ
        π ThinkCode AI – A GPT-powered R Programming Assistant that helps troubleshoot code, explain bibliometric functions, and guide basic syntax Π
        π ThinkDraft AI – An Abstract Scaffold Generator that offers structured prompts to help interns organize and begin writing their research abstracts Π
        Λ
        These tools are completely optional and are designed to enhance (not replace!) your learning, especially as you navigate coding and scientific communication.
        ρ Ρ ρ Ρ
        By participating in the beta, interns also play a key role in shaping the future of these tools. Planned features for future cohorts include:
        λ
        π Seamless integration with RStudio and Quarto Π
        π Scaffold templates for posters and oral presentations Π
        π AI-assisted literature review and citation support Π
        π Personalized learning prompts based on quiz results Π
        Λ
        Currently, these tools are included at no additional cost for BRI interns. In the future, they will be offered as licensed educational tools for independent learners, schools, and institutions.
